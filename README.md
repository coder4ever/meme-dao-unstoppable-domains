# Name

MEME DAO

# Description

MEME DAO is a platform that gives credits to meme creators and allows people to post memes and bids to an auction that they can approve or reject

Then when the auction is closed, the highest bidder is charged (if someone withdraws their allowance before closing they are no longer eligible) and is then able to collect their nft.

Mirrors can't be collected (users can still bid, but the frontend shouldn't give them the option).

Allows folowers to include a "member" flag in the call to follow. This charges them a fee and adds them to the module's storage as a member of the profile. A whitelist could be implemented.
